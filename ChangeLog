ChangeLog: cfng
===============

------------------------
cfng 0.1.1 (2004-05-26)
------------------------

This initial release of cfng primarily intorduce changes to the names
and directory structures under /var/cfng (or WORKDIR). A great deal of
internal code cleanup also went into this release, an effort that is
ongoing and isn't expected to be completed for another couple of
versions.

A complete set of documentation is forthcoming after we have got around
to review the GNU cfengine reference and tutorial, and will initially be
made avalable at: http://cfng.org.
