.SH NAME
cfservd \- cfengine server daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
/usr/local/sbin/cfservd [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cfengine
is a language based system specifically designed for testing and
configuring unix\-like systems attached to a TCP/IP network. Cfservd
is a file server and protective wrapper for starting cfengine
remotely. It performs access control based on RSA authentication and
IP address.
.PP
The daemon looks for a configuration file cfservd.conf by default.
Cfservd gives little information when it fails to serve. This is by design.
More information can be obtained using the debug option -d2 on both
client and server ends.

.IP "-d (--debug)"
Enable debugging output. (parsing \-d1,run, \-d2, lite \-d3)
.IP "-h (--help)"
