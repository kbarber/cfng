Comments :

1. ? Matches a single character. Skip over with pointers.
2. Check that the compare string hasn't run out too soon.
3. If the wild-match is complete return MATCH!
4. other wise check that the wild card string hasn't run out too soon.
5. * Matches any string.
6. Skip over any *'s in the wildcard string and leave pointer on the
first character after.
7. If the last character in the wildstring is *, match any remaining
   characters...
8. ...except no string at all. e.g. xyz* doesn't match xyz
9. Advancing this pointer by one, prevents * from matching the null
   string even when the pointers haven't reached the end of the string
   (so that the match is not complete).  This works because it screws up
   the pattern match in the routine `AfterSubString()' by removing the
   first character from a string which might otherwise match.  e.g. it
   stops *.c from matching .c because the strings which get passed to
   AfterSubString are `.c' (from *.c) and `c' (from .c).
10.Isolate the next string sandwhiched between wild-cards or string
   delimiters. Copy to buffer.
11.Make a note if we hit the end of wildstring in the process.  i.e. is
   this the end of the strings we're matching?
12.The call to this routine checks whether a match is allowed between
   the isolated string and the comparison string. If a match is allowed
   it updates the pointers so that they point to the next characters
   after the match. Otherwise it returns NULL.

AfterSubString()

13. You can't find a string larger than big inside big!  (This could
    occur because of points 15. and 9.)
14. If the last wildcard was just to match a single character then the
    string match must be anchored to the current pointer locations.
15. If this is the end of the strings to be matched, then make sure the
    match also correctly identifies which pattern matches the END of the
    string. e.g.  to avoid confusion over *.abc in .abc.abc.abc
16. If the last wildcard was a * or none, then use a forward floating
    comparision which can skip over anyjunk characters looking for the
    next occurrance of the string.
17. If this is the first two characters in the string and there is no
    match, give up. This anchors the floating match to the start to
    avoid a*b matching xaxb by skipping over the first x!
18. If there is no match yet, there's no chance!
