README: cfng
============

DISCLAIMER: This is a technology preview. Due to the extensive amount
of updates to the original cfengine code, chances are that we have 
introduced issues that don't affect GNU cfengine. This release is
functionally equivalent to cfengine 2.1.6, mostly with changes to
the WORKDIR directory structure and some minor adjustments to a few 
actions. See ChangeLog for details. At this point standard cfengine
configurations should be compatible with cfng.

cfng is a framework for configuration management and to a large extent
based on a fork of GNU cfengine (http://www.cfengine.org), a suite of
tools to define systems and execute system administration tasks. We 
want to bring the code base to a state where collaboration is easier
and continuous development and maintenance is spread to more than just
the main developer.

The project is not affiliated with the main cfengine developer, Mark
Burgess or the general GNU cfengine project, but it is our intention to
feed back any improvements or fixes that we find to cfengine.

Mark has made enormous contributions to the field of automation and
system administration over the years and cfng builds entirely on code
that he engineered, but we are in disagreement on the state of the code,
inconsistencies in it, lack of version control, and the general
structure.

Any issues with cfng should be reported to us and users are discouraged
to bring these to the main cfengine channels. Mark Burgess and other 
cfengine developers are not in any way responsible for this code and have
explicitly stated that cfng is not something that is of interest to him.

However, the cfengine tutorial and manual is currently the best source
for information about how to configure and run cfng. This will be
addressed in the future when the initial work has stabilized. For now
cfng is a drop in replacement for cfengine and has 100% feature overlap.

cfng is developed and maintained by Kent Skaar and Luke Kanies. Issue
tracker and mailing lists are available at:
