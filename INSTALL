=============
INSTALL: cfng
=============
$Id$

DISCLAIMER: This is a technology preview of cfng and information in this
document might be incomplete.

Standard install steps::

    ./configure \
        --prefix=/usr/local \
        --with-berkeleydb=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB4.1 \
        --with-openssl=/usr/local/openssl-0.9.7c 

The default location where cfng will look for it's own configuration
files and write data, lock and log files is under::

    /var/cfng

This can be changed with (example)::

    --with-workdir=/cfng

Note that on most platforms cfng binaries are able to use libraries copied
to WORKDIR/lib/ instead of the default library search paths.

Below is included information about the cfng default locations


cfng locations: summary
=======================

This document describes the default file-system locations for cfng (which
is somewhat different from cfengine, if you have a previous installation
with this). The changes in cfng were made to:

1. Make naming more descriptive of the files and directories functions.

2. Prevent variable data from being written to locations higher up in
   the file system hierarchy than more static files, such as binaries
   and semi-static configuration files.

The default location for cfng related files is ``/var/cfng``. This can be
over-ridden with the ``--with-workdir` argument to ``configure`` at
compile time.

  /var/cfng
    bin/                    [empty]
    data/                   [optional]

    keys/

    outputs/
    spool/                  [optional]
    state/

- bin:
  The primary use for this is as the location where ``cfexecd`` looks for
  ``cfagent``. You could chose to store all the cfng binaries here to be
  consistent (see cfng_container.txt).

- data: [optional]
  This optional directory is the client side store for files and
  directories, which are copied from a centralized location. (This could
  be by means of cfservd or other methods, such as rsync or cvsup).
  The name is arbitrary (it is not actually used by cfng binaries) and could
  just as well be ``dist``, ``templates`` or ``sources``.

- inputs:
  This is the primary location for files parsed for cfng binaries,
  notably ``cfagent.conf``, ``cfservd.conf`` and ``update.conf``.
  Additional information and recommendations for content and structure 
  of this directory can be found in cfng_inputs.txt.

- keys:
  The ``keys`` directory contains the public / private key pair used in
  communications between ``cfagent`` and ``cfservd``. For ``cfservd``
  the public keys for clients allowed to communicate with the daemon
  need to be stored in this directory.

- lib: [optional]
  cfng is compiled with a runtime path pointing to /var/cfng/lib. This
  allow you to contain libraries (libdb and libcrypto in particular), so
  that system wide modifications doesn't impact cfng's ability to
  operate properly.

- logs:
  Note that the primary log output for cfng binaries is syslog, so the
  logs directory is currently only for the lock and setuid logs.

- modules:
  Location for cfagent modules. These need to be called:
  module:<modulename>.

- methods:
  Location for cfagent methods.

- outputs:
  This contains spooled output files that are normally emailed to the 
  system administrator.

- spool: [optional]
  You can have backup copies for changed files stored in this directory
  by setting ``Repository = ( /var/cfng/spool )``. Dated filenames are
  default for everything except the copy action, where you enable
  this with ``backup=timestamp``

- state:
  The state directory contains all of the internal state data for cfng
  binaries, such as the checksum databases (action -> file ->
  checksums), cfenvd's data-files and the lock file databases.
